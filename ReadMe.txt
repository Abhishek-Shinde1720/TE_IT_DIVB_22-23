Brief Description:
This project aims to implement a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with Chatbot Automation using Machine Learning. The primary goal is to provide an intelligent and automated customer service experience to the users, where the chatbot can handle routine customer inquiries, assist with product or service-related queries, and redirect more complex issues to a human customer service representative.

The implementation includes the development of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and integrating it with a CRM system. Also developing a prediction model for future prediction sales. The chatbot uses Machine Learning algorithms to learn from previous interactions and improve its performance over time. The CRM system is used to manage customer data, track interactions, and provide insights to the business to enhance the customer experience.

This project can be useful for businesses looking to automate their customer service operations, improve response times, and increase customer satisfaction. The system can also help in reducing costs associated with customer service and improving overall efficiency.
